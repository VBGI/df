PROBLEM STATEMENT
-----------------

* Constructing a decision tree for `Df`-species classification purposes;
* Studying relationships between environmental factors and leaves/... morphometric features;
* Estimating interspecific variability of the set of morhpometric featrues


MATERIALS AND METHODS
---------------------

Initially, source data was presented as an array, consisting of mixed type variables, quantitative and qualitative ones, that describe
the morphological featrues of six `Df`-species and environmental conditions of its collecting places. The array's shape was 589x33 (totally, 589 items were used in analysis).
The number of columns, i.e. 33,  accounted the number of item features, including its species, leaves/... morphological features etc.
Quantitative features consisted of the following variables: ['L1p1l','L1p2l','W1p1l','W1p2l','L2p3l','L2p4l','W2p3l','W2p4l',
'S2p3l','S2p4l','Lkd','Wkd','OtnWLkd','Dvsh','Dosh','Lp','Dpl','Lns','Wns','Lvs','Wvs']
